    <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">This chapter provides background and discussion on the technology and methodology
        underlying the Radiant software design environment.</p>
        <p class="p">Understanding some of the fundamental concepts behind the Radiant software framework
            technology will increase your proficiency with the tool and allow you to quickly come up
            to speed on its use.</p>
        <p class="p">The Radiant software is a next-generation software design environment that uses a new
            project-based methodology. A single project can contain multiple implementations and
            strategies to provide easily managed alternate design structures and tool settings</p>
        <p class="p">The process flow is managed at a system level with run management controls and reporting.
            Context-sensitive views ensure that you only see the data that is available for the
            current state in the process flow.</p>
        <p class="p">The shared memory technology enables many of the advanced functions in the Radiant
            software. Easy cross-probing between tool views and faster process loops are among the
            benefits.</p>
