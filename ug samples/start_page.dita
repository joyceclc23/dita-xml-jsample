    <shortdesc>This section describes the major sections of the Start Page in the Radiant
        software.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>The Start Page contains the following three major sections:<ul id="ul_dfz_r2p_fyb">
                <li><b>Project</b>: This section allows you to create a new project; open an
                    existing Project, and open an example.</li>
                <li><b>Information Center</b>: This section has links to Getting Started, Tutorials,
                    User Guides, and Support Center.</li>
                <li><b>Recent Project List</b>: Provides a quick way to load a recent project youâ€™ve
                    been working on.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>The Start Page appears in the View area by default when the Radiant software is first
            launched, and can be opened from the View tab on the menu. The Start Page can be closed,
            opened, detached, and attached using the Attach button.</p>
